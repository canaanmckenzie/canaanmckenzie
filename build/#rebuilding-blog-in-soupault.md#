## rebuilding my blog in soupault : a digital garden

<time id ="post-date">2023-10-24</time>


*ikigai* (ee-key-guy) is a japanese concept that combines the terms *iki*, meaning "alive" or "life," and *gai*, meaning "benefit" or "worth." this blog is a collection of *some* of the things wherein i find worth and wellbeing pursuing happiness and fulfillment. caveat being that it is also a space to explore and present new ideas, projects, successes, and failures. as such, it is a collection of living documents. a digital garden i tend. enjoy your stayfizzle away unmaintained. 

recently however I stumbled upon soupault. the user freedom in the project's vision drew me to it. i realized i missed that from the nascent era of the millenial internet where i first began my denizenship. this blog is going to encompass whatever catches my interest and i feel is worth writing down. i'm hoping it will be as minimal as possible while still serving as my portfolio, notebook, and canvas.
