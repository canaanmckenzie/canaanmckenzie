    I decided to rebuild my blog site in Soupault, while I've used Eleventy, Pelican, Hakyll, Jekyll, and even built (several) blogs from scratch in the most basic HTML/CSS/JS configuration I could, I stumbled upon Soupault. The clear direction of the project and it's clarity of vision outside of predined frameworks drew me to it. I realized I missed the a lot of the nascent era of the millenial internet where I first began my denizenship. This blog is going to encompass  whatever catches my interest and I feel is worth writing about. I'm hoping this blog will be as minimal as possible while still serving as my canvas and notebook.

    <em>Ikagai</em> (ee-key-guy) is a Japanese concept that combines the
terms <em>iki</em>, meaning “alive” or “life,” and <em>gai</em>, meaning
“benefit” or “worth.” This blog is a collection of <em>some</em> of the
things that I find worth and wellbeing in commiting myself to for
happiness and fulfillment. Caveat being that it is also a space to
explore new ideas, projects, successes, and failures. As such, it is a
living document. A digital garden I tend. Enjoy your stay.
