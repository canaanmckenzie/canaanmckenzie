## Rebuilding My Blog in Soupault : A Digital Garden

<time id ="post-date">2023-10-24</time>


*Ikigai* (ee-key-guy) is a Japanese concept that combines the terms *iki*, meaning "alive" or "life," and *gai*, meaning "benefit" or "worth." This blog is a collection of *some* of the things wherein I find worth and wellbeing pursuing happiness and fulfillment. Caveat being that it is also a space to explore and present new ideas, projects, successes, and failures. as such, it is a collection of living documents. A digital garden I tend. Enjoy your stay.

The impetus for this post is that I decided to rebuild my blog site in Soupault. While I've used Hugo, Eleventy, Pelican, Jekyll, Hakyll, and even built (several) blogs from scratch over the years, they typically end up listless and I have let them fizzle away unmaintained. 

Recently however I stumbled upon soupault. The user freedom in the project's vision drew me to it. I realized I missed that from the nascent era of the millenial internet where I first began my denizenship. This blog is going to encompass whatever catches my interest and I feel is worth writing down. I'm hoping it will be as minimal as possible while still serving as my portfolio, notebook, and canvas.
