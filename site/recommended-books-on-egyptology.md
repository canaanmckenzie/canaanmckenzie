# My Recommendations on Learning Hieroglyphics

<time id ="post-date">2023-10-25</time>


Why?

Good question.

Other than being something interesting, it also presents an opportunity for some computer vision research, parsing through images of glyphs and feeding them into what I hope will be something of a recognition engine for deciphering hieroglyphs. This extends beyond egyptian, but when I was looking around for a training set, I settled on this since I have the books and their digital formats readily at hand. 

**Middle Egyptian**

Start with middle egyptian, it's the easiest to learn in the beginning and the books are easier to parse.

Allen, J., 2014.*Middle Egyptian: An Introduction To The Language And Culture Of Hieroglyphs*. 3rd ed. Cambridge: CUP.

Collier, M. & Manley, B., 2003.*How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs: A Step by Step Guide*. 2nd ed. London: British Museum Press.

Faulkner, R., 1962. *A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian*. Oxford: Griffith Institute.

Gardiner, A., 1957.*Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs*. 3rd ed. Oxford: Griffith Institute.

Ockinga, B.G., 1998. *A Concise Grammar of Middle Egyptian*. 3rd ed. Mainz: Verlag Philipp von Zabern.  


**Late Egyptian**

The next stage is late egyptian, I would recommend beginning or at least having a book on coptic, here is what I use,

Lambdin, T.O., 1983. *Introduction to Sahidic Coptic*. 1st ed. Macon: Mercer University Press.

also pick up an ancient greek dictionary because if a word isn't coptic there is a fair chance that it is greek. i personally use.

Woodhouse, S. C., *English-Greek Dictionary : Vocabulary of the Attic Language*. George Routledge & Sons, Limited. 1910.

for the late egyptian itself,

Černý, J. & Groll, S., 1993. *A Late Egyptian Grammar*. 3rd ed. Rome: Biblical Institute Publishing.

Junge, F., 2005. *Late Egyptian Grammar an Introduction*. Oxford: The Alden Press.

Lesko, L. & Lesko, B. eds., 2002. *A Dictionary of Late Egyptian*. 2nd ed. Providence: B.C. Scribe Publications.

**Ancient/Classical Egyptian**

Arguably the hardest part of the language, to be honest these can be hard to find/read, so I strongly recommend starting from the top and see how you are doing if you are trying to do this based solely on book learning and don't get about a third of the way through and immediately started building symbolic recognition models to help you do this computationally like I did.
